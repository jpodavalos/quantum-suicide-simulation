A quantum suicide/immortality thought experiment simulation using Python. 

## The Concept

_The quantum suicide thought experiment involves a similar apparatus to Schrödinger's cat – a box which kills the occupant in a given time frame with probability one-half due to quantum uncertainty.[note 1] The only difference is to have the experimenter recording observations be the one inside the box. The significance of this is that someone whose life or death depends on a qubit could possibly distinguish between interpretations of quantum mechanics. By definition, fixed observers cannot_

_At the start of the first iteration, under both interpretations, the probability of surviving the experiment is 50%, as given by the squared norm of the wave function. At the start of the second iteration, assuming a single-world interpretation of quantum mechanics (like the widely-held Copenhagen interpretation) is true, the wave function has already collapsed; thus, if the experimenter is already dead, there is a 0% chance of survival for any further iterations._

_However, if the **many-worlds interpretation is true**, a superposition of the live experimenter necessarily exists (as also does the one who dies). Now, barring the possibility of **life after death**, after every iteration only one of the two experimenter superpositions – the live one – is capable of having any sort of conscious experience. Putting aside the philosophical problems associated with individual identity and its persistence, under the many-worlds interpretation, the experimenter, or at least a version of them, continues to exist through all of their superpositions where the outcome of the experiment is that they live. In other words, a version of the experimenter survives all iterations of the experiment. Since the superpositions where a version of the experimenter lives occur by quantum necessity (under the many-worlds interpretation), it follows that their survival, after any realizable number of iterations, is physically necessary; hence, the notion of quantum immortality"_ - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_suicide_and_immortality

------------------------
To my understanding, quantum suicide is an experiment to test that if the many-worlds or multiverse theory is true, given the infinite number of tries, you're maybe dead on one/this world but alive on the other (quantum immortality).

## How the program works
The program will generate a random number from 0 to 1. If the random number is less than or equal to 0.5 (simulating 50/50), the object is alive else the object is considered dead. The program whill show the number of tries, highest number of tries that the object is alive, and the **chances** of it happening.

## Test
The Python program was activated in a DigitalOcean VPS (1GB plan) on July 29, 2021.
As of 07/31/2021, the highest number of tries that the object is alive is 40 with a 0.00000000009% of chance happening!

```
Number of tries: 704,861,067,397
Highest counter: 40
Chances of this happening is: 0.00000000009094947017729282379150390625% - 2021-07-30 02:13:46.122378
```
As of 08/08/2021, the highest number of tries that the object is alive is 42 with a 0.00000000002% of chance happening!

```
Number of tries: 4,372,370,638,687
Highest counter: 42
Chances of this happening is: 0.0000000000227373675443232059478759765625% - 2021-08-08 22:59:29.229361
